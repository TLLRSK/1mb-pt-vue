Brieffing:

Create a chatbot window


Framework: Vue 3.0;

Requisites:
- The messages from the chatbot must be different from the user ones, positioning them right and left its the easiest way to fullfill this one
- The image and the name of the chatbot must appear so that the user knows at all times who they are talking to.
- The chat window must have a drop-down menu to select options such as forgetting user data, changing the language or accessing the privacy policy.

- Implement:
    - Image-card messages
    - Chat Buttons
    - Other kind of messages or enhancements you want to implement and think would be a nice implementation

- The design does not have to be super sophisticated, but it must at least responsive and full-screen on mobile phones.
